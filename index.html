                <!-- About me -->
                <p>
                    I am a Junior at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank" title=“”>University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> triple majoring in Computer Sciences, Economics, and Mathematics. I am also pursuing the certificate of Art, Studio and
                    focus in Graphic Design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am interested in the applications of Computer Sciences, especially data analysis and machine learning, to other fields to try to solve challenging problems. I applied the analysis of acoustic data into the research of the marine ecosystem. I am also
                    exploring the interdisciplinary between Computer Sciences and Economics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This year, I have the opportunity to utilize Machine Learning in the research on the rainforest biodiversity for the project “Tropical Stethoscope” in the <a href="https://www.soundforestlab.org/" target="_blank">Sound Forest Lab</a>                    with professor
